Coding journey pt3.


After working in rust (I’m still learning and by no means an expert quite yet, but I’m working towards it!), I was directed to take a look at how Tokio works along with some other server nuances that if I didn’t know about it could really mess up my code. This was the most difficult thing for my brain to comprehend and focus on for some reason. It’s the situation where you are reading a book but you find yourself reading a full page and thinking, “huh.. I didn’t comprehend any of that; let me read it again” and being stuck in that loop. I had to take lots of breaks to go work on something else and learn little by little of Tokio, but I see that things like Tokio are how apps like Doordash work, so it’s stuff that I need to know.

While learning about Tokio I was also learning Linux commands because I had not worked with a linux system at all before 6 months ago, but I think I picked them up pretty well and relatively quickly which I was very proud of myself for.

Things like this seem so obvious to the learning process, but I’ve found most people who are trying to teach others code and lots of tutorials to teach new coders will assume they already know things like linux commands and emacs because to them it’s been common knowledge for so long, but oh boy is trying to learn coding from going through the rust book so very confusing when just trying to type things on a terminal without knowing you NEED these things to really do anything more than download something. It can be super confusing to both student and teacher, but once you get it down it gets so much easier.
