coding journey pt.4

Back to talking about rust,
one of the other projects of note was the guessing game. The first part was to use rust to tell the system to generate a random number , you can print it to screen to confirm the code ran correctly but for the game itself you have to ask rust to hide the random number and wait for an input. Once it has the input it asks rust to look back at the generated number and compare. You would make sure the generated number was within a certain number bracket like between 1 and 100 and it would take the number you input as a guess and compare to the generated number and spit back in text that the number was too high or too low and when guessed correctly it would output a congratulations message. To get it to compare more than once and to input multiple guesses when you got it incorrect I had to get the code to loop which was brand new for me at the time but I thought the concept was really cool and the thought crossed my mind that this was probably how alot of my favorite games growing up likely had loops involved in the making of them where you could replay when you died like “game over!… play again?” and it would wait for your input and if you selected play again it would loop back to the beginning of the code or the start of that game.
