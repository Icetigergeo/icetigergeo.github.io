Over the course of the past three to six months, I have learned a lot about coding and tech that I never could have dreamed I’d ever learn. I began my coding journey with kind of a rough start, as I have always been more of the creative work-with-my-hands type of person with painting and working with clay, so getting into the right mindset for coding and combatting my pre-existing code blindness has been quite the frustrating adjustment. I know it will be worth the brain calibration once I’m able to use it!

The first thing I learned was SQL. I actually really like SQL, and I had lots of ups and downs learning it. For instance, the "where" statements and "from" statements were a fun challenge for me to calibrate to, and I redid the online challenges on W3schools over and over and over again to make sure that I could remember how they worked. As I was learning other things, those would stick, but oh goodness when I started learning about SQL "join" statements, that was a big nightmare mess, and it took me lots of frustrating attempts to understand it. Sometimes it still doesn't make sense to me. I remember asking my mentor why the heck is there even a (insert join name here) if you could just use a standard "left inner join" instead? Someone somewhere uses that kind of join, but apparently it's in rare cases, so I was proud of asking that question.
