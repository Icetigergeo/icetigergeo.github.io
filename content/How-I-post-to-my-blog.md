I wanted to type out the steps I take each time I post a blog post to my website both for me to revisit and anyone else reading this who may need it.
I made my website through Zola so if you are unfamilliar with zola please take a look at this site (www.getzola.org).



Step 1. Make a file on Github with what you want posted in it and give it a file name

Step 2.In the computer terminal use git mv to move that file intp zola 
//(example:   git mv coding\journey\pt.6  content/coding-journey-part-6.md)

and it will rename the file with ".md" at the end so zola can work with it.

Step 3.Edit the file to put: 
+++
title = ""
date = ""
+++
before the file content starts at the top.

Step 4.Save and close the file,run the Zola build command, git status

//(I had a weird thing happen here where it says docs/CNAME was deleted so for this I had to do a git checkout docs/CNAME)
git add all things listed as modified and untracked files

Step 5.Zola serve and check that the changes look how you want them to look by copy pasting the URL it gives you in the terminal to view your sample post in a browser

Step 6.If all looks good git commit

Step 7.git push

Step 8.Wait a few minutes for the changes to appear and look at your website in a browser (not the sample site) and the changes should appear there! Tahdah! post completed!
