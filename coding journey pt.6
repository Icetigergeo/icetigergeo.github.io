My coding journey pt.6

Learning Rust coding language:

Learning rust has been a wild ride for me especially after learning Sql. There are so many things in rust to memorize unlike SQL which has closer to maybe 20-30 commands and nuance coding techniques to remember but rust has what feels like the entirety of an english dictionary to learn, they really aren’t kidding when they say “coding language” you really are learning a whole LANGUAGE.
When I started the “Hello world” project I was thinking oh neat all I have to do is Println!(“Hello, World!”); and it will print me a nice little message I hope all of rust is like this….. spoiler its not. 

I started learning from https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ which was very helpful for starting out definitely would recommend. Then once I got to a little bit after programming a guessing game (Lot’s of fun to play with by the way) I started a course with https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-rust-from-scratch. This one is in some ways easier to understand but also harder in that when it has you do a coding challenge some of the code you have to write to get the correct solution is not mentioned or listed in the course like a small nuance “ we thought you knew this already” rust command which in some ways is helpful to rewind and look up what that particular command means and what it is used for but in a challenge mode to put something that was not mentioned in the portion you learned from was super tricky and frustrating.
In my personal experience with this rust learning course I have a difficult time with math equations and for some reason my school did not teach one of the forms of math listed in this course (Factorials) so I definitely learned more new things than I thought and the math sections took me way longer than I’d like to admit. The sections with word problems though and explanations not using equations I understood much faster and with more effiecency to retain the knowledge and repeat it back like Enums, they used a stoplight and chess pieces to explain enums which actually helped me alot to understand you could use enums to help you if you are trying to get something to move around and you can label the thing you are moving like to tell the white knight chess piece to move vertically and get the black knight to move horizontally.
